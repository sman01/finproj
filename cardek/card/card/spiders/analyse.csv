Best for new car users. It has a very good resale value and a good market so it's easy to resale. Maruti service too is best.

This is a nice car with good handling and is very comfortable, also mileage is good.

Very nice car within this segment. The good budget car also the mileage is good. But there are no safety features in this.

The car is good and I enjoy driving. My car quality is very good and all the functions work properly.

Nice car and nice mileage, very good color, this car is my favorite car because this is my dream.

This car is best for the small family and it has a very low service charge compared to other cars.

Maruti is a nice car with good fuel economy, its engine is powerful and also it has a low maintenance cost. And is highly recommended.

It's a very good hatchback and best car for families. Even I have one. The car gives very good mileage.

This is a great car having all its features best. Also, the service cost is less . Highly recommended.

Maruti Alto 800 is a very comfortable car middle-class family. It has very less maintenance cost. Also, the spare part cost is also very low.

 

First of all, I know it is a little late to write a review for Alto 800 which was bought in 2012. 7 years now and still going strong. Its 90000 km now and still I am getting mileage of 20 kmpl. Pocket friendly and efficient in city. Considering the price, obviously, you can't expect luxurious features. If someone needs a car for city drive, its bes...
Amazing car for the family. Mileage in the city is around 18 after turning on the AC. Best in the segment but looks are not as good as Kwid.

Maruti Alto is a very nice car. It has gone mileage. Low maintenance, good comfort, nice looking.

Alto 800 is a very good looking car. I want to say that this is a family car, anyone can buy this car and this is a comfortable car.

The new bs6 variant has more boot space. They have a refined colour combination of interior earlier it was totally black. Runs very smoothly. Mileage 20km in the city.

Excellent car and amazing mileage. The air-con is great and the steering is nice. But lacks in some of the safety features like EBD and ABS. Quite affordable it is, more or less, the car is excellent.

Amazing performance and best in the budget and has low maintenance.

Better than older Maruti 800 as the interiors are awesome. Amazing security with 2 air-bags.

This car is very comfortable with a stylish look and triggered mileage.

Maruti Alto 800 is the best car for a small family of four people. Gives better milage as per the cost of the car.

Whatever written in this box has been genuine of my almost 2-year of experience. Indeed, it was quite easy and a good buying experience hassle-free at all I had been so glad. This car has been so lucky to me as far as my budget and maintenance to be concerned it was quite made for the low budget family car who is financially not so well. After purc...
Purchased CNG variant and I drive it daily for 100kms. Now my car readings are in 60,000kms. I must say it is a money-saving car. Small and fit in your budget. Until now there is no need of any special part change. Keep your car service ready when it's service time.

Maruti Alto 800 has got good mileage in limited budget, good car for small family, nice AC cooling, pickup is good, power window, good space, from company side- time to time received updates for example - insurance, service staff supporting, good test drive before hand over to owner I am very happy with Maruti. Thank you all for the support.

It is the best fuel-efficient car. Amazingly suits city driving. Grip and balance on the highway are pretty good.

Top car mileage and the gear shift is just awesome like butter. However, on highways, while overtaking it is not much efficient.

One of the best car in my life because this car is still there. It is best for the long drive because it gives great mileage with great pick-up and a low maintenance car forever. I suggest everyone for this car. I and my family are very impressed by this car. Thanks, Maruti.

The average very nice. I like this car because the average is very nice. The maintenance cost is also very low.

Best car in mileage, pickup and its a 5 seater car, normal setting in the car with safe driving and braking is very good and ac/heater with 2 power window at the front, the best car.

Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 is the best family car. It is safe to drive and a very good service provided by the brand.

A good car for city and short weekend drives. Easy to drive in city traffic. Many service centers are available and low maintenance costs, as well as spare parts, are easily available.
