Review,Sentiment
" i just bought my  reno a few days ago, and so far im very impressed with its performance and ride quality. mpg arent too bad, but they could be a little better. for about - dollars you could expect to ride for a pretty good bit on a full tank. thats pretty good compared to a much bigger vehicle. my roommate has a minivan, and that take anywhere from thirty to forty dollars to fill up, and gas doesnt last half as long as it does in mine. im , and this is my very first vehicle, and so far im very happy, and well satisfied with my purchase.",good
" i bought this  reno with , miles on it. its my ride from home to work and back. this is the first small car that i have ever owned. i traded in my  lumina (k miles)and $ cash and drove it off the lot. so many of the reviews have been less than complimentary, but as an owner, i think this is a great little car.  year/k mile bumper to bumper, a k powertrain warranty, and  hour roadside assistance. i dont like the fact there arent many dealerships around for service concerns, but i have only had one issue with the airbag light staying on all the time. remember that you get what you pay for. i bought a -cylinder automatic. i dont expect to keep up with a vette!",good
" we bought this car with a sonata in mind but the price point was to much to pass up.  its peppy and quick for such a small engine. plan to put on wheels, cruise, tint and keyless with an alarm.  love it get lots of second looks in the parking lots.  put on a coat of turtle wax ice and it looks great. only problem was pass seat airbag light but was resolved in one visit. k out the door cash and we are really happy with it! lots of room for a small car and with some things like new wheels and tires maybe springs it will handle even better. also try a k&n airfilter it will bump up the hp and gas mileage! had a suzuki motorcycle and this lives up to the name!",good
 i drive  miles a day and i get from  miles to  miles on a full tank of gas so the mileage is alright. needs cruise but hey its a good price on a car that get me to were i gotta go ,good
 i just purchased this vehicle but thought it odd there were no reviews from users on this vehicle (expert reviews are unkind). it truly is a bargain and drove every bit as well as a ford focus. yes it is basic but for $ a month for  months and  down how can you go wrong especially with the warranty this manufacturer offers. we all are facing some realities with gas prices escalating and while the given mileage specs arent overly impressive most people are getting better than posted mileage. the interior is very nice a pleasent surprise this is the first time i have considered a compact car and i will be ok with this. i didnt feel silly in it and the suzuki moniker adds intrigue,good
" good car for the price with a good warranty. comfortable, good looking. lots of base price features. its zippy, quiet, and rides well. ",good
 i would’ve given it all  star but i’m an honest man.... headlights are garbage they just love to short out.....  transmission is garbage no dipstick maintenance free and the mechanics can’t give me a transmission flush because it takes a special square tool to get the access port  that they didn’t have and autozone and advanced auto didn’t sell it either online it was  dollars. transmission skips like crazy and is a safety hazard.... visibility is poor out the front but horrible in the back.... listen this car is garbage the bad out weighs the good,bad
" i got an  reno in october of . it had k miles. i was surprised to find that this vehicle did not have cruise control, as many older vehicles (different make) do. the mpgs are not very good, even when using high octane fuel and keeping maintenance regular (correct air pressure in tires, clean air filter, oil changes ever k miles). ive already had to replace the head gasket in the engine. come to find out there was an air bag/warranty issue for renos, that effect/affect mine, according to the vin. not sure if it was the best choice, but i needed a car. its still good, just think that an  vehicle, regardless of who its from, should have cruise control. according to good ol google,  renos get  city and  highway.",bad
" bought this car and an emergency car in january  after i totaled my last car. car was great for  months when the check engine came on. turns out it was the throttle body,  which was no longer made. dealt with it for another year and few months before everything started going wrong. lower control arms needed replaced, quickly followed by having to replace the entire shifter assembly.  both front and rear struts need replaced, including the mounting and stabilizers. rack and pinions are starting to leak, has to replace a oil gasket, and now the throttle position sensor is shot. only a dealer can calibrate a new one, and you have to replace the whole throttle body, not just the sensor. only  miles on this car, it shouldnt have all these issues!",bad
" ive been reading reviews and not one was good. my reno will fly, i read one that said it had trouble keeping up in traffic. to be a . this car is fast, i believe very dependable. ive had no trouble,its a little rough on gas. but alot better than my  cylinder.",good
" i purchased my car in  at , miles, and the biggest problem is that it isnt good on gas. also, i was told by a mechanic at a a goodyear service center two days ago that i might need struts, rack and pinion work and rods!!! even though the car was given a clean bill of health just six months ago, and only has , miles on it. today, i went to the suzuki authorized service center and they said i dont need anything but an alignment and new wipers. they thought the struts where getting dry, but not a problem. seems to me goodyear wanted to make a little money.to be safe, i am taking it to a third shop just in case. luckily, i purchased an extended warranty.",good
" i purchased this car in . since then its been in the shop at least  times. ive had major issues with the transmission sensor. when the sensor goes bad the car does not move. i was driving this car to work at the speed limit of , then i had to stop for a light, when i was taking off the check engine light came on and the car had almost no power. if i knew then what i know now i would have opted for a better car. i would never purchase another suzuki. i guess you get what you pay for. oh and getting rid of it is much more difficult considering its worthless.",bad
" ok. so i see all these bad reviews on here, and dealing with the public i know more people complain than compliment. so here goes my story. this is my second reno. first one had for  months, , miles. no problems. until it got totaled when got hit by a semi truck. i walked away from the wreck. this one now has , miles and no problems. the a/c is poor, but tint the windows and that takes care of  things at once. makes the car look even better and helps the a/c. i wish they still made this car cause i would buy another one. ",good
" i bought this car used.  i have not had to do anything to it except oil changes and standard maintenance stuff.  its almost time to replace the tires.  the price of the standard tires was higher than i expected.  every tire place i went to said they were not a size they stocked, so that was surprising.  but overall, i really like the car so far.  have not had any mechanical issues.  the main thing is to remember it is an inexpensive car, dont expect it to drive like a mercedes or youre setting yourself up for disappointment.  but great car, glad we bought it.",bad
" i purchased my vehicle in . i hate it. it only has ,. miles on it. my transmission is failing, the air bag light is on, and engine light is on too. i called suzuki to help me. but i have to pay for everything to see whats wrong and most thing arent covered. it doesnt start always. i have  children and i am unemployed at this time. they told me that only interior thing are covered under warranty until , miles. the transmission is not shifting right and it jerks when it shifts. gas not so good. i called corporate and they couldnt help me either. not worth the money. too many problems. and its not only me. what should i do.",bad
 i purchased my car because i needed a four door due to having a child & i wish i never had! i had over $ in work done and was told it should help the gas mileage it made it worse. now they tell me its normal. they dont tell you about recalls until you call for other issues or hear about it from someone else. i had the transmission replaced & that took over two weeks &  different transmissions. the dealer never called me i had to call them to check on the car. my brother also has one and he has had his in the shop more than he gets to drive it.  my suggestion is dont ever buy a suziki they are the biggest piece of crap ever made & they dont care as long as you are making your payments! ,bad
" i bout this car used at  miles for about  grand at an auto auction.  i have had this car for almost a year and i have have no problems with it so far, engine is easy to maintain.  one issue is that the dashboard can glare on to the windshield, but other then that small detail the car is a good one to own for high school and college age kids.",bad
" i work as a salesperson in the car business and i drive a variety of cars and trucks on a daily basis. some are nicer, faster, bigger, and tow better than others. for me, this vehicle works. i work downtown and i needed a small, reliable commuter that was reasonable on gas but still fun to drive. this car delivers. i bought it with just over k miles on it and so far have had no problems. the flat torque curve of this engine allows it to pull even in  gear which is unusual for a car this size. i went with an  for reliability due to my short ownership. the car handles like a go-cart and winds up nicely. i paid k used (its a )- (a deal a customer could have gotten) value-wise-- !",good
" this has to be one of the best deals ive ever gotten on a used car. bought  it less than a year old, with  miles.  the cost was already / of a new one.  all the complaints ive read about have never happened to me.  there were  recalls that the suzuki dealer performed - one for a wiring harness, one for a seatbelt thing, and the other for the running lights.  i took this car on a road trip across texas and back and was very good on gas.  for $ i put a pioneer radio and it made all the difference in the world.  the speakers are actually very nice sounding if you put some wattage behind them.",good
 love the car. got what i expected which was reliable service with no a problem to date at  thousand miles. car has good vision fields and ride is tight and solid but it is a small car ride so if you think youre getting a lexus at this price wakeup... although with all the radio and cruise controls on the steering wheel you will feel like you got more than you paid for. oldest kid going off for college this fall. she wants and will get one for graduation. ,good
" we purchased our reno right after we got married as a nd car, boy what a mistake we made.  i think the car stayed in the shop more than we drove it; head light continues to go out for now reason, airbag light on, dealer dont know why, no good a/c heater output, replaced tires under a year, middle console will not close and we had to the timing belt in less than a year.  this car is a piece of crap, cant trade cause its worth nothing.  biggest mistake we ever made",bad
" this is the worst car i have ever owned. i started having problems when it was only a few weeks old. it took forever to get the problem fixed. then the car had the head light not working problem. then my front drivers seat came disconnected from the base. the tires wore out in under a year. the check engine light keeps coming on for no reason. the mileage is not good for that small a car. i was just told that i already need to replace the rear breaks. the service from suzuki is bad. they knew about the starter problem when i called and told me they were working on a fix, i would just have to wait. i only had the car for less then a month. it is a bad, bad, bad car. i used to love suzuki.",bad
" we have , miles on our reno and have not had it in the shop yet. it starts easily and is pretty good on fuel. i drive  miles round trip to work and run a few errands around town in it.  it is a manual  speed and we average  miles per gallon consistantly around town. the air is pretty weak and living in florida can be a bit frustrating. overall, we have been pleased but we are holding our breath. we also owned a suzuki verona at the same time that was a nightmare - we finally got rid of it, thank god.",good
" to start, let me say i really do love this car.  but, it has had many problems that make it annoying at times. i had the problem with it not starting for the st mo i had it-the dealership could never fix it but it stopped happening. then i had an airflow problem (scary)- the tires wore out (low profile)at . and, ive had non-stop issues with the airbag sensor, that they just cant seem to fix. i was just told that it would probably need a new serp. belt soon. but, the car is fun to drive, sporty, decent on mpg. mpg could be better for a car this size, but its better than an suv! if you know how to drive the automatic as a manual (as you can in this car) really gets up and goes. ",good
" we bought a  reno a few years ago and so far has been a reliable car, overall i like the car. im around -ish and i fit comfortably into the vehicle. no knees into the glove box, no hair touching the upholstry on the roor. has gotten a bit cramped with the addition of a car seat, had to move pass seat forward.  have not had any major mechanical problems to this point. have not experienced the bad starting as some others have. did eat through the factory serp belt though by ,. have flushed the engine cooling system and serviced the auto trans, no problems with the fluid exchanges either. mpg is nothing to totally rave about, but full it once a week, not terrible.   ",good
" i kept looking at that reno sitting up a pedistal outside the dearlership for about a month. the looks and the price was very attractive. i decided to stop and see how the performance was and to tell you the truth. i was actually surprised by what that . liter will do. if your not afraid to put your foot in it, it will get you down the road quick. anyway, i am "" and i fit in that car like jim carey says, ""like a glovvvveee"". it handles real well, and the mileage...omg...i go to illinois from alabama and i dont stop for gas until i get to champagne which is like  miles from huntsville. i love this car. great car!",good
" i bought the car and to be honest with you, stock, the car isnt much, but after putting some "" rims, limo tint, a sound system, underglow light, a custom grille and much more, that car has turned into a one of a kind here where i live. the manual has a lot more power than it look like. adding nos, turbo chargers, intake, exhaust will really make this car get up and race with the best.  if anyone wants a car at an affordable price that you want to fix up and make unique, then i recommend this car",good
" i like my little red tomato. its great on gas, i went from patchogue to riverhead everyday and it costs me $ - $ filling at / tank, depending on the gas prices for the week. for the price its a good car, i havent had any problems.",good
" i bought this reno new and since day ""two"" its been nothing but trouble.  the second day it left us stranded and wouldnt start.  the dealer towed it back said it was fixed.  we got six miles from dealer it stopped again.  the dealer had it for six days returned it said it was all fixed.  then three days later the same thing happened, it wouldnt start.  the dealer had it again and replaced more parts.  it runs now, but gets poor fuel economy - only  mpg in the city.  yesterday my wife started it, turned on heater, and it sounded like a bomb went off.  there was some acorns packed in heater.  we called dealer and he said it was not their problem.  i took it apart and there is no screen over the heater motor under hood and it was full of nuts.  the tranny still doesnt shift right.  i will never buy another suzuki.  it is the worst car i have ever bought!",bad
" while overshadowed by bigger names such as the toyota scion series, mazda, honda, and others, the suzuki reno stands as the under dog. with ""european styling"", a comfortable and spacious interior,a fun driving experience, and an affordable price tag, the suzuki reno is perfect for the average college student or young person. the reno is an all-around fun car, and you wont be embarrassed to show it off to your friends. i would suggest the suzuki reno to anyone in the market for a very nice and practical new car.",good
" the reno is a great car if you like getting  mpg around town, and cranking the engine multiple times to get her started. i had to crank my  two dozen times once trying to go home from work for an appointment. add to that several trips for service every few days for nine months while suzukis ""engineers"" worked out a ""fix."" the ""fix"" should have been to give me a full refund of my money!",bad
" the suzuki reno is totally unreliable. after i had the car for just five days, i began to have problems starting my  reno every morning. after two and a half weeks with the car in the shop, i was put in a  reno, which developed hard start issues, again in five days. in both cars, the passenger airbag off light stayed illuminated regardless of my having a passenger. the dealer put me back in the original reno, claiming its been fixed, which i do not trust yet. suzuki never returns my phone calls. their customer service is non-existent. if i could get them to void my contract, i would and i would never again buy a suzuki or recommend one to anyone, even my worst enemy. dont even consider this car!",bad
" i bought this car to have a dependable vehicle.  it has had so many problems.  i have had it in the shop for the transmission (x), the washer fluid box (x), the air bag (x), the windshield wipers (x), and the ac (x).  every time, the dealership promises the car is fixed, but it certainly is not.  now they are saying they are not going to pay to have the ac fixed because they claim a mouse has gotten in it.  yet, they have no proof of this.  im really getting fed up with suzuki.",bad
" i looked at the reno as a way to save gas money and miles on my ""toy"" that is horible on gas and was racking up too many miles.  i like the usefulness of the hatch, the features, and best of all the price.  i have not had any real problems with the car with the exception of a computer reflash that fixed the idle problem.  i hit it a bit on performance (see below), but the car is fun to drive and performs up to expectations and then sum when compared to the direct competition.  i still like to drive my expensive sports car, but dont miss it too much on comutes in the reno.  oh, its gas milage is realy good.  i keep track of it.  i geuss suzuki doesnt overblow the numbers like most do.",good
" the suzuki reno has a great air conditioner, its cold air at start-up, and tinted windows, something the other small cars do not seem to have. these things have a lot of value in the southwest desert. it runs smoothly and is very quiet at and above the posted speed limit on the highway. the seats are comfortable and the audio is great.   it comes standard with  wheel disc brakes and good sized "" tires.",good
" the reno is a great car with italian design. it has more power than the toyota yaris, honda fit, scion xa or xb, and the chevrolet aveo. it has more standard features and a longer warranty as well. i bought this car for well below invoice. i love this car. you can not find a better value.  compare it piece by piece to the others and you will see. ",good
" i just purchased this car because of its looks and how it drives, on the road all you see these days is hondas and toyotas i wanted to be diffrent and bought a reno.  the car is very spacious and very confortable, it rides well too.",good
" suzuki makes a great car. the build quality, fit and finish a reliability challenge the best compacts out there. but it seems that the rest of the world sees suzukis as ""bottom of the barrel"" cars. this is definitely not true. i have been so pleased with my reno. my gas mileage is better then what the sticker stated. i average - mpg with local driving. the car is extremely roomy and comfortable. the transmission is smooth and easy-maybe not as refined as a sentra or corolla - but better than any focus, cobalt or elantra. i just bought my wife an xl-, she loves it. if you like the european style and the practical benefits of a hatchback, test drive a reno-you will be pleasantly surprised.",good
" i bought this car new after months of looking online at cpo / used cars.  i actually got it for well below invoice price, which was one major reason that i purchased it.  i am pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance of it.  the interior is simple yet stylish, and has plenty of room.  the exterior is a sleek, european hatchback look.  there are great features included for the price.  i am actually pretty happy with my purchase.  the only thing i am disappointed in is the fuel economy.  a car this small should be able to get more than  mpg (city).  my  honda civic gets  mpg.",good
" its easy to miss the suzuki reno. it is overshadowed by the heavily promoted scions, toyotas and hondas, little suzuki is well, little known. i hadnt heard of the reno until i saw one at the auto show, and was immediatly drawn to it. after an hour of test driving it, the reno sits in front of my apartment. aside from the obsurity of the car, what really sets the reno apart is the amazing level of standard equipmet. my base model came with side airbags, power windows, locks and mirrors, steering assist,  speaker am/fm/cd/tape, and of course the european insired hatch design. my only complaint is the gas mileage is not up to the standards of the class (see honda fit, scion xa, etc). ",good
" when i came home with the suzuki reno, most people asked ""what is that?"" the first comment made by most people is ""it looks very european.""  it truly is one of those cars that makes an appearnce in every french film. this car is a hidden treasure, consider that power windows, locks, mirrors, an am/fm/cd/ tape palyer, heated mirrors and side airbags all come standard on the base model! the  speed manual transmission is smooth, buttery, and matched to the . liter engine makes for a peppy little car!",good
" i bought this car as a replacement to my  vw. value for the money, you cant beat this car.  no problems whatsoever.  i have entered this car in several autocross events and it has shamed cars costing at least twice as much.  the styling is distinctive and euro, a nice touch.  interior is simple, the way i like it with just the right amount of convenience such as power windows, mirrors, and locks.  although the cars suspension is soft (see below), the overall balance is great.  if suzuki can bump the car up to about  bhp and stiffen up the suspension at least % the car would be a hit with hot hatch enthusiasts everywhere.",good
" the suzuki reno is a perfect car for students, couples and singles. if you are in the market for a coupe...go for this one.  it looks neat and small, but its actually spacious inside has more room for tall people. it is very smooth.  you dont even feel it when you are going  miles an hour.  its brakes are good. what else do you need in a vehicle that costs less than $,.  rather then buying a used vehicle, buy a suzuki reno.",good
" i own a  suzuki reno and im very happy with its performance. im lovinit. it comes standard with a ton of features for the price and i must say that it is a great value. it looks beautiful from both the inside and outside. it runs better than a honda civic. its so smooooooooooooooooooooth, you gotta drive it to feel that. if you dont want to take my word for it, go out and give it a try.  im sure youll thank me. ",good
" so i have only had my  suzuki reno for about two weeks but it has been pretty impresive for the money. lets face it, its a cheap mode of transport. but its got some class thats for sure. i think the italian design really helps. to me it looks better than cars out there that cost twice as much. its very european looking.  it could be that the car is actually a holden viva from australia which was basically rebadged as a suzuki.  overall i have been quite impressed by this stylish little guy. if you like the little european cars (like i do), then you wont be dissapointed.   test drive one and i think you will see what i mean.",good
 take your money and throw it out the window. everything breaks very easily.,bad
 this car is riddled with electrical and sensor problems. had to get them to replace the headlights. very bad acceleration and shifting. probably the worst car ive ever had. its my fault i didnt do enough research on this car. it was inexpensive and fun to drive but now im already really wanting to trade this piece of crap in for a mazda  hatchback. which i should have bought in the first place. trust me do not buy this car you will not drive it!,bad
" i bought mine new and have always had an issue with it having gaps in acceleration. dealer said nothing wrong. clutch worn very fast  k or so. dealer said i had to replace i still have not  k. my major problem is it has always had poor gas mileage and codes it is not running effiecient. i have replaced the throttle body and sensor since you cant get just the sensor, o sensors, plugswires etc. it has had all normal and regular maintenence. the ""gaps"" are getting worse and it is not an automatic. the automatic ones just shift gears at any time. no problems with these have ever been a recall. i owned a kia before and never had any issues. i can see why these cars are gone !",bad
" my quarrel is not with the car, which is built in korea by daewoo, but with the service and treatment of the suzuki dealers.i have only had two issues with this car in , miles, but the last one was the last straw.i was charged $ to fix a defective $ electronic sensor.i watched the mechanic take  minutes, but they charged me  minutes labor. i told them what was wrong, internet supported common problem, and they charged me an additional $ to diagnose it.i am trying to unload the car now and i would caution everyone away from suzuki cars.they dowble talk you with big warranties for which you still have to pay if the engine or trans do not fail completely.stay away!",bad
" i am not happy at all with the transmission in this car. i am already repairing the clutch. the transmission has too much play and is very finicky  with rpm to get a shift at the right time for ""economy""  i have always driven stick shifts.  i have , on the car right now, as i commute a good distance to work.  would not be my choice again. i miss my kia !!!!",bad
" i bought my car in april of  when i got it it was bone stock i got the blue metallic ive since added wheels intake, exhaust, chip, bigger injectors and ported and polished the intake. have not had one issue with this car and im a abid street racer i keep up with evos and stis this is awesome grand stock its very slow but for the money u get lots of standard features **** the ford focus there base modek car has crank handles to roll up the windows. to bad they they dont make the reno or forenza anymore i think suzuki was dumb for recalling them.",good
" i recently purchased a spd reno (k) for a commuter. i drive  miles round trip to work, about % interstate. the car is better than expected. the editor reviews seem to be a bit harsh. the ride is good, pretty quiet, handling is ok, peppy engine with the  spd, no problems merging etc.the standard features are way above the economy class norm. the mpg has been close to advertised, i have ranged between -. mpg with an average % city % hwy driving. hwy speeds between - mph. if you are looking for max mpg, look elsewhere, the reno offers a pretty good package at the current used prices, shop around and get one at trade-in value and you will have a good st car or commuter.  ",good
" i had this car for almost  motnhs and never had a problem with it. i enjoy driving it and not bad on gas mileage, actually i bought the car to save gas even if i was looking for chevy cobalt. the dealer gave me this because the cobalt was a little bit expensive and i have another loan thats why they didnt gave me the cobalt. anyway, i didnt regret having this car. and it can fit up to  people including driver and you can park anywhere (easy to park) and as most everyones saying. i did expect to get more than + miles per gallon but im only getting  on highway and  city. and i compared the back seat to a chevy impala ss and the reno was bigger. i like this car",good
" i purchased my reno as a birthday present to myself. i love my car, and how it hasnt broken down yet. ive owned mine for about six months now. the interior is very roomy, and the instrument panel is very simple and logical. styling is very european, and theres plenty of space in the trunk. my only real complaint about it, is that i wish there were a more powerful engine option. i know this is an economy car, but i really wish that it had like the sx- engine option. the suspension could be a little stiffer, i mean it handles well, but id like less body roll. again i know this is an economy car, but sometimes you may have to do some avoidance maneuver.",good
" i have this car less than a year and have no issues so far. it is comfortable, quick and good on gas. if you floor it, only then do you suffer poor gas mileage. sometimes i cant help it since i am so impressed by this small motor. for a . this car is very fast. for anyone who doesnt want to hurt their wallet, this car beats any toyota thats similar in size. ",good
" i just purchased one and i love it. great looks, great paint, fun to drive. the options it comes with are great am, fm, cd player front and rear wipers, easy controls. just a lot for a little.  i have owned a focus in the past and there is a lot in this car that the focus didnt have for the price. and the warranty, well that itself almost sold me the car. ",good
" first off, let me tell you that i am one of those guys that races every car i buy.  i am a mechanic as well so i do all my own engine work.  i have modified my reno with minor modifications and i do pretty well at the track with it.  because of the type of car that it is no one ever sees it coming and they underestimate it.  it does great on a drag strip but the handling leaves a lot to be desired.  i bought the car for a work vehicle initially but then my curiosity got the better of me and now that i have raced it i am thoroughly impressed with it.",good
" a fun vehicle to own. not only can i go when i want with the quality travel i want, but it is very versatile for a family of  (me, my wife and my  month old son).",good
" the suzuki reno is a superb value.  up and coming suzuki delivers with just the right formula.  it has unique and attractive styling, in and out.  it also has lots of standard features, pretty darn good stereo cd with four -way speakers and four "" tweeters (all  are door-mounted).  i like its smooth acceleration and seamless shifting.  it has nice "" tires with full wheel covers.  i also like the -way driver seat plus -position lumbar support. its no hot rod, but for less than $, theres a dohc . liter -cylinder gm-designed engine that is more than adequate (made in australia).  obviously, the gas mileage will not be / like the tin cans out there get, but / aint bad.  plus, youre getting a lot more car for almost the same price.  definitely check this one out.",good
" i love it the reno.  it is small sleek, stylish, has power everything, and costs less than $,.  enough said.",good
 i bought the reno because i desperately needed a car.  i should have done more research.  my car has had starting problems many times.  it also gets terrible gas mileage for a compact car.  i average about  mpg with city and highway driving.  a friend has an  impala that gets  mpg with a v engine.  the seats are a little uncomfortable and the manual transmission is terrible.  how much would a decent linkage cost suzuki to put in.  the engine is also underpowered.  i am considering trading in the car for a cobalt since the reviews that i have read about it are quite good. ,bad
" the reno has a lot more get up an go than i had expected. on my trip home from the dealer i had stopped for a traffic signal and pulled out when the light changed and was up to  mph when i realized i was still in th gear. i got  mpg on the trip home from the dealer. i decided to drive from home to the top of whitetop mountain (, ft to , ft altitude). it went  up the mountain at  mph in th gear with no feeling of strain or handling problems on the  mph curves. when the pavement gave way to gravel and  inches of snow i down shifted to th gear and slowed down to  mpg and zipped past several  wheel drive vehicles sitting in the ditches. mu  mpg on the trip was excellent. ",good
" so far my reno has been a good solid car.  i have the manual transmission.  its power is ok for a car in this class.  the interior is a little uncomfortable, but with an -way adjusting driver seat and plenty of front leg room, its ok. it sounds good, i havent noticed excessive wind noise yet.  backing up is a little troublesome. coming from a ford ranger with a very open rear view, it feels a bit claustrophobic looking out the rear window. overall, at the price i bought it, im very satisfied.",good
 i love it. the reno is everything that i need and nothing that i dont.  it is spacious for such a small vehicle.  the base level is what i went with and with such an affordable price tag who could pass it up?,good
" i was put into a  suzuki reno after i had hard start issues with the  model after having the car for just five days.  the  model developed hard start issues, again after just five days.  the dealer put me back in the , which he claims is fixed. this issue first became apparent in the  last spring, although the company has yet to develop a permanent fix. suzuki claims (through the dealer) that the hard start problem is limited to the  and the  i got was a fluke. if i could get suzuki to void my contract, i would and i would never again buy a suzuki or recommend one to anyone, even my worst enemy.  dont even consider this car!",bad
" overall this has been an incredible little car, especially as a first vehicle. i can turn on a dime, parallel park like a boss and theres plenty of room. i used this car to move into an rv for a few months and all of my clothes/personals including my mountain bike and lb dog fit into this little car. not gonna say it was the epitome of comfort but i would definitely do it again. this car gets great gas mileage, especially if you arent one to accelerate and then brake heavily (about mpg on average). there have been some recalls on the headlights but suzuki fixes it all for free (this has happened twice in he past  or so years). i replaced the original stereo with a kenwood, and now i can plug in any usb/aux and it charges my phone simultaneously. i only gave the technology  stars because i use my phone for all that (navigation/bluetooth) and didnt want to skew the rating unfairly.",good

" so my best friend has had her reno since  so over the years road trips have been abundant!this car is sooo much fun!! i love it more than anything. i am actually about to by an lx for my commute to and from work. the reliability is beyond expectation, i mean, we have put over , miles on it in  years!she just keeps going. now, the bad thing is that the stereo system in the doors went out quickly, the fact you have to push down to shift from drive to park, etc.. has made the shifter loose & you have to press the shift towards the driver to make sure it locks in when turning off the vehicle. other than that i cannot complain!",good
" bought used with k miles on it.  it now has over k and no major problems.  putting a k&n filter, lighter flywheel pulley and a new exhuast turned this car into a beast.  one of the few cars i could find in a  spd. my wife and i used it as an autobahn cruiser while we were stationed in europe.  loved the surprised looks on bmw owners faces as we passed them doing +mph!  we love this little car and plan to run the wheels off it.  it has been dubbed ""road runner"" by the wife because its quick and fun to drive.",good

" manual version is very fun to drive as long as you dont mind driving the stick. the car is looking great from behind; very sexy. it has great lines and it feels sleek and ""in style"" even after  years. i recommended it mostly for in-town commute. i drove it from atlanta, through dc and ny, when i moved up to chicago. i drive it in chicago and it fits perfectly here; easy to park, easy to move around on short distances. i dont understand why only . in editors review.",good

" i was apprehensive about buying a small car such as the reno, but after test driving the kia rio and then the suzuki reno i was assured that the reno was the car for me.  the reno out-performed the rio with its acceleration, comfort, noise level and cost!  i love my little reno. it would be just perfect if only it got a wee bit better gas mileage for its size.",good
" my suzuki reno is the second suzuki i have owned.  i also currently own an xl-.  i love this car.  the interior is set up great and there is plenty of room for me and the kids.  the sound system rocks and the ride is as smooth as silk.  the braking with the  disk brakes is sharp and the speed sensitive steering is awesome...especially in parking lots etc.  the only knock i have so far is the gas mileage isnt great.  hopefully that will improve as the car gets broken in better.  i highly recommend this vehicle to those looking for a small reliable car!  you cant beat the  year / , mile warranty either!",good
" we recently purchased a new  suzuki reno.  we are very pleased with our purchase.  we love how quiet and relaxing it was to drive/ride in.  the gas mileage is pretty good (mpg).  we also own a  geo metro so were big on gas mileage.  we were complaining about wanting more room on longer trips and wanting  doors.  so we very pleased with the roomy interior, safety features, and the hatchback style.  the cargo room is something we have been wanting more of and we are thrilled!  we cant wait to go on our first camping trip!",good
" hello, i purchased my suzuki reno just about a month ago and i have had nothing but great compliments from everyone. if you are looking for a good reliable car this is it.  for all the standard features that came with it, it was a great buy. i realy enjoy driving it. for as small as it looks it has a lot of room in the inside. i looked around at a lot of cars , but the suzuki reno had everthing that a lot more expensive cars didnt for the very reasonable price. yes it may not get top gas mileage, but it gets good mileage. i live where it snows and it just snowed a few days ago, it drove and handled very well. all i can say is before you make up your mind on a car, do yourself a favor go test drive a reno!",good
" great little car that is inexpensive and fun to drive!  if youre looking for an inexpensive / economical yet stylish little car i highly recommend it  mileage has been about  in combined highway / city driving and as high as  in straight highway.  thats not to shabby.  power is average but adequate and i concur with the professional reviewers that recommend the  speed over the automatic, it couples the power to the wheels much better than the auto.  styling does turn some heads and ive been asked about it from a few people. interior is good and functional. list of standard features is great but has no cruise control standard which is strange.  im pleased, this is a great commuter car.",good
" although i was impressed with the reno lxs ride, features, performance, and quiet cabin, the following items turned me away.  . very weak ac, which i found in all three renos i drove. sub-par at best.  . poorly designed sunroof operation, with no ""one-touch"" closing, requiring you to keep a finger on the button and your eyes on the sunroof as it closes, meaning having to take your eyes off the road to make sure it stops and seals where it should instead of going into vent mode. frustrating, and a safety hazard while driving.  . tight rear storage. not enough lateral room for my guitar cases without putting seatbacks down. that means no passengers.  . sub-par gas mileage  no thanks.",bad

" ive had this vehicle for about seven months, and they have been great! the car handles beautifully and i love the sound of the engine reving up. in the city i cant drive so fast but on a recent trip to las vegas i had fun! handles curves nicely, great on inclines, and great mileage for gas!

" i just purchased my reno a month ago and have really enjoyed driving it. while not as good as my focus in the handling department, the ride quality seems to be on par. once you get used to the not so tight handling, you can have fun in this car. i would recommend the reno to anyone who wants a comfortable, affordable vehicle for the daily commute. the standard features are awesome, but i would recommend skipping the automatic, unless you like slow acceleration and a buzzy engine.",good

" we needed a car with more interior room than our previous hyundai accent, which otherwise had been a great car.  after shopping around we chose the reno.  we received a lot of rebates with this car and found all of its features very intriguing.  so far the car has been great, even though we only have the base model it has power everything and a/c.  the gas mileage is a little disappointing, but is in no way terrible.  all in all a great car so far!",good

" i bought this car few days ago and i wanted to share how excited i was driving this car. from afar the european design catches the drivers eyes. very roomy, sporty, strongly built, with a predictable steering when strolling or cruising on  highway. high quality for the crafted interior as well as the sound system. comfort gets a  as well. the base model comes with a lot of ""power everything"". the engine performs outstanding. i think it is a great, great value for the money.",good
